  Throughout the semester, our team committed itself to the development of a FocusBot system â€“ an innovative solution that aims to enhance the productivity of remote developers on a team. Our system provides a comprehensive suite of productivity aids, all aimed at enabling developpers to efficiently handle their workload and stay on track. In an era where remote work has become the norm, the challenge of consistently achieving and maintaining high productivity has never been more daunting. This challenge is particularly pronounced in the field of software development, where project requirements evolve continually, and new tasks emerge with frequency. Our solution seeks to address the challenges posed by both remote work and software development to boost productivity and ultimately enhance the overall performance of remote development teams. So, this repository serves as a collection of our insights and progress across the various milestones within the course, encompassing everything from the initial proposal to the requirement, design and testing phases.
